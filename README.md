# [Smart Energy Supply Scheduling for Green Telecom Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/smart-energy-supply-scheduling-for-green-telecom)

The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry currently consumes approximately 3% of the world's energy and contributes about 3% of global carbon emissions. In alignment with Climate Action goals, the mobile industry has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. It is worth noting that, on average, more than 90 percent of network costs is spent on energy bills. The increasing energy cost (diesel price 55% increases YOY, Electricity price: 38% increases YOY) accelerates green transformation of telecom industry

Mobile networks are powered by various energy sources, including traditional electricity grids, solar panels, and diesel generators. In countries with unstable electricity grid supplies, diesel generators are often used to ensure continuous power for mobile networks. Each energy source impacts energy costs and carbon emissions differently and may be available at different times of the day.

Electricity grid availability is dictated by an "outage plan," which specifies hours when the grid is offline. Solar power generation is influenced by weather conditions such as relative humidity and solar irradiance indices, such as diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI), direct normal irradiance (DNI), and global horizontal irradiance (GHI). Diesel generators are considered to be always available as power backup when needed.

To reduce network energy costs, it is crucial to predict daily solar energy generation and create strategies that minimize energy costs while ensuring network stability.

This work aims to develop machine learning (ML) models to devise optimal strategies for utilizing diverse available energy sources to power the mobile network.
